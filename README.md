📰 Fake News Detector
This project is a machine learning-based fake news detection system that classifies news articles as real or fake. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning algorithms to analyze and verify the authenticity of news content.

🔍 Problem Statement
With the increasing spread of misinformation online, there is a growing need for tools that can help automatically detect fake news. This project aims to provide an intelligent solution for this issue using data science and machine learning.

🧠 Solution Overview
Utilizes a labeled dataset of real and fake news articles.

Preprocesses news text using NLP techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization (TF-IDF).

Trains a machine learning classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes).

Outputs predictions on whether the news article is likely to be genuine or misleading.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

NLTK

TQDM, WordCloud

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Results
Achieved ~90% accuracy on test data.

Includes performance metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.

🚀 Future Scope
Integrate with a web interface for real-time news classification.

Use deep learning models like LSTM or BERT for improved accuracy.

Include source credibility and social media signal analysis.

📁 Dataset
Used a labeled dataset of fake and real news articles. (Make sure to credit the source if you’re using a public dataset like Kaggle.)
